# Grocery_Management_System
This Project deals with Grocery Store Management, with it's GUI developed with Tkinter and for database, we have used MYSQL.
main.py needs to be executed. This module has imported all other modules(one module for each table in MYSQL) and the user will be redirected from there.
Operations such as Add, Delete, Update and Search can be performed in each window.

# Run main.py file  
#It has buttons with images on it. Click on any available button and it will take you to a new window
#corresponding to the button clicked. There we can perform the operations such as - 
#Insert, Delete, Update and Search. The edit button provides the options to update and delete
#You can only edit once you select the item displayed on the screen.
